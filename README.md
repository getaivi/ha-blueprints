## Blueprints for Home Assistant

This repository is where the official Aivi Home Assistant blueprints are
developed. For details on the available blueprints and how to use them, see the
[blueprint documentation](https://docs.getaivi.app/home-assistant/blueprints/).

## What is Aivi?

Aivi is the simplest way to connect your devices to a real-time Live Activity
on your iPhone. By making a HTTP call to the Aivi API, you can track the
progress of anything – from a washer machine cycle to a progress of a 3D print.

### Features
- **Broad support.** Supports live activities on iOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, CarPlay
  and MacOS<sup>1</sup>.
- **Shared activities.** You set it up once by inviting people, and a single
  API call automatically updates everyone’s devices. No extra work needed to
  keep the whole group in sync.
- **Live activities for any device.** Most smart home devices do not offer live
  activities. Aivi bridges that gap, allowing you to add them to all your
  devices, old or new.
- **Power-Efficient.** Because Aivi only sends data when something changes,
  your devices do not waste battery constantly polling for updates.


<sup>1</sup> Mirroring live activities on MacOS is currently not available in
the EU.
